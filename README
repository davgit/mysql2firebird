Small parser that changes from MySQL to Firebird syntax. Currently it only supports
database structure dump (no data, only structure) from PHPMyAdmin. Not
all datatypes are supported, but feel free to "fix" it. It's written
in PHP and it's open source. 


Here is a quick overview


Make sure you test the output before using it in production. It does support some tricky 
stuff like auto increment columns and LAST_INSERT_ID. There is a 
stored procedure for this at the end of the script, you can call it 
like this:

select id from last_insert_id;
On Windows, you can run the program like this:

php.exe -f mysql2firebird.php mysql_dump.sql > firebird_dump.sql

Once you create the Firebird script, make sure you search for text 
WARNING: which might indicate some incompatibilities. For example, 
Firebird does not have tinyint, mediumint and unsigned datatypes. 
Also, check for TEXT and LONGTEXT. Iâ€™m using UTF8, so I converted 
those to varchar(8000), which might not be what you want. Maybe BLOB 
SUB_TYPE 0 would be a better choice
